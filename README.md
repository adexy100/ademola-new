# Ademola A. Website

Static portfolio site for an IT solutions and automation specialist. 

## Features

- SPA-style client routing with fallback
- Dark/light theme toggle with saved preference
- Mobile-responsive navigation
- Scroll animations and stat counters
- Portfolio filtering, contact form simulation
- Tailwind CSS utility-based styling (via CDN)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and run a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server` or serve with any static file host).
2. Browse to `http://localhost:8000` (or appropriate port).

No build steps required; all assets are static. If you want to add tooling later, consider initializing npm and installing Tailwind locally.
